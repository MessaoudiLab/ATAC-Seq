# ATAC-Seq Pipeline
This pipeline is intended for work within the UCR computer cluster as it assumes access to several software packages. 
Some of the steps also require a large amount of memory to execute.
It is strongly advised for the user to execute the scripts through submission to the cluster, rather than using a local node.
