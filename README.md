# ATAC-Seq Pipeline
This pipeline is intended for work within the UCR computer cluster as it assumes access to several software packages. 
Some of the steps also require a large amount of memory to execute.
It is strongly advised for the user to execute the scripts through submission to the cluster, rather than using a local node. 

Each step is labeled and should be followed in sequential order from 1_QC to 6_diffbind.

The folders for the steps contain a script for the corresponding function and links to manuals for the required software modules.
