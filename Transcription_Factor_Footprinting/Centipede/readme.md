# Centipede

## Introduction
CENTIPEDE is a computational method to infer if a region of the genome is bound by a particular TF. It uses information from a DNase-Seq experiment about the profile of reads surrounding a putative TF binding site. Further, it is able to incorporoate prior information such as sequence conservation across species.

Use of a computer cluster is highly recommended as this data analysis requires a genome reference file and a .bam file, both of which will be several gigabytes in size. 
## Prerequisites

### Data
1. Position Weight Matrix: a probability table describing TF motifs; [search here](https://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools/pwmbrowse.html)
2.
